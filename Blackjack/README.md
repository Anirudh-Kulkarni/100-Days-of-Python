## Blackjack Overview
  - Known as 21, Blackjack is a card game where the goal is to have cards totaling as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
  - A hand totaling over 21 is called a "Bust," resulting in an immediate loss.
  
##  Card Values
  - Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value.
  - Jack, Queen, and King are each worth 10 points.
  - An Ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on which is more advantageous.

##  Game Rules
  - Initial cards are dealt to both player and dealer, with one of the dealer's cards concealed.
  - Players can choose to take additional cards to improve their total.
  - If a player's total exceeds 21, they lose regardless of the dealer's hand.
  - If both player and dealer have the same total, the game is a draw.
  - Dealer must take another card if their total is 16 or under.

##  Simplified Game Mechanics for this Program
  - Cards are represented in a list with 2 through 10, Jack, Queen, and King all having a value of 10.
  - Ace starts as 11 and changes to 1 if the total exceeds 21.
  - The game assumes an infinite deck, meaning drawn cards are not removed from the deck.
